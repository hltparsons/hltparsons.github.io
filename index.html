                    <p>My vision for learning is to create an environment in which learners are empowered to develop critical thinking, 
                        confidence, and take pride in their learning in a context relevant to their own lives; where effort and risks 
                        are acknowledged and appreciated; where students are represented, can lift each other up, and construct knowledge 
                        together through collaboration; in which I am a facilitator of growth and positive change.</p>

                            <li>To develop relationships with students so that I may attend to their social-emotional and academic needs, 
                                set high expectations and boundaries, and so that we can learn from one another.</li>
                            <li>To use learning tasks that allow students to apply concepts to their own lives, both by bringing previous 
                                knowledge to their learning and applying their knowledge in areas that are relevant to themselves.</li>
                            <li>To encourage and make space for students to collaborate with one another and work independently to further 
                                their knowledge and their development of learning skills.</li>
                            <li>To incorporate and honour different cultural ways of knowing in the classroom by decentering Eurocentric cultural 
                                values historically viewed as neutral.</li>
